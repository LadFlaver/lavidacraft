                    <h2>What is a File Hash?</h2>
                    <p>File hashes are like a unique fingerprint for a file. To create a file hash, a hashing algorithim is used.
                        The algorithim creates a fixed-size code that identifies a file. File hashes can be used to
                        verify that a file you have downloaded has not been tampered with. If the hash listed on the website
                        and the hash of the file you've downloaded do not match, this is a sign that the two files are not the same. 
                        Even if a single bit has been altered, this is almost always reflected by a different file hash. 
                        Though different files can end up with the same hash, the chances are next to none.
