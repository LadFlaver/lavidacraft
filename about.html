<p><strong>Why doesn't anything look different?</strong></p>
<p>LavidaCraft does not change very many textures and many changes are very subtle. Trust me there are differences.</p>
<p><strong>Why does the website look so bad?</strong></p>
<p>I hope you don't think that, but if you do it's because this website was written in notepad++ rather than being created in a website creator.</p>
<p><strong>Where did the name LavidaCraft come from?</strong></p>
<p>The name LavidaCraft came from my old username Laviday_Flaver. I combined Laviday with Minecraft brining you LavidaCraft. Later on I changed my username to Lad_Flaver because people could actually prounonce it and people wouldn't abbreviate it to weird things.</p>
<p><strong>Why don't you make it so the user can individually pick each feature they want then download that?</strong><p>
<p>I don't do this because I don't even know how to do that and the user can just delete the files they don't want.</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between LavidaCraft Official and Lavidacraft?</strong></p>
<p>First of all if you even noticed this at all, I'm impressed. Lavidacraft was the first series of texture packs I made. The original idea was to change the textures I didn't like but soon I found that I had been changing many textures. Wanting to bring myself back to the original idea I decided to make Lavidacraft Favorites. It removed the low quality and low effort textures and only kept the ones I liked. I later decided to name the pack LavidaCraft Official, the name that remains today.</p>
<p><strong>How do I pronounce LavidaCraft</strong></p>
