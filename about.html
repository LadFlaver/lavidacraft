                    <h2>What is LavidaCraft?</h2>
                    <p>LavidaCraft is a resource pack for Minecraft made by me (Lad_Flaver). It is not a retexture of the game, but rather improvements and tweaks to various parts of Minecraft while striving to preserve the Vanilla feel.</p>
                    <h2>Why do some features differ between the Java and Bedrock versions of LavidaCraft?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Minecraft Java Edition and Minecraft Bedrock Edition implement many features very differently from each other. This makes it difficult to make features consistent between versions. There are some features which simply aren't available or too difficult for me to implement into the Bedrock version. I will continue to do my best to support the Bedrock version.

                    <h2>How is LavidaCraft pronounced?</h2>
                    <p>Luh-vee-duh-Craft</p>
                    <h2>Why isn't LavidaCraft published on bigger websites like CurseForge?</h2>
                    <p>This project is meant to stay small. If it were published on bigger websites, it might get more attention, which I want to avoid.</p>
                    <h2>When and how did LavidaCraft start?</h2>
                    <p>
                        LavidaCraft started early in 2019 in a Discord server with my friends. The name of the pack is based off my original username "Laviday". There's no record of when I made the first release, but the second release was made on March 28, 2019. 
                        It started because there were small details in Minecraft which I thought could be improved. I began working, but very quickly grew out of proportion as I began retexturing the whole game with very low quality textures. 
                        This was not the original point of the pack. Realizing this I began a very short lived project titled LavidaCraft Favorites. It saved my favorite changes and threw out the rest. 
                        Afterwards, I restarted the project as LavidaCraft Official. The word Official was dropped when I made LavidaCraft 1.5.
