<p><strong>Welcome to the LavidaCraft website!</strong>
<p><strong>What is LavidaCraft?</strong>
<p>LavidaCraft is a Minecraft texture pack that changes a small amount of textures to make the game look slightly better.
<p><strong>Why doesn't anything look different?</strong>
<p>LavidaCraft does not change very many textures and many changes are very subtle. Trust me there are differences.
<p><strong>Why does the website look so bad?</strong></p>
<p>I honestly hope you don't think that, but if you do it's because this website was written in html rather than being created in a website creator.</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between LavidaCraft Official and Lavidacraft?</strong>
<p>First of all if you even noticed this at all, I'm impressed. Lavidacraft was the first series of texture packs I made. The original idea was to change the textures I didn't like but soon I found that I had been changing many textures. Wanting to bring myself back to the original idea I decided to make Lavidacraft Favorites. It removed the low quality and low effort textures and only kept the ones I liked. I later decided to name the pack LavidaCraft Official, the name that remains today.
